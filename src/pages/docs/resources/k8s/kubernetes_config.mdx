# Kubernetes Configuration `k8s_config`

<Intro>
The k8s_config resource allows Kubernetes configuraton to be applied to a 
`k8s_cluster`.

You can specify a list of paths or individual files and health checks for 
the resources.  A `k8s_config` only completes once the configuration has been
successfully applied and any health checks have passed. This allows you to 
create complex dependencies for your applications.

Jumppad monitors changes to the config defined in the `paths` property and 
automatically recreates this resource when `jumppad up` is called.

## Properties

<Properties>
  <Property name="cluster" type="nomad_cluster" required="true" value="">
    The reference to a cluster to apply the jobs to. Kubernetes config
    is only applied when the referenced cluster is created and healthy.

    ```hcl
      resource "nomad_job" "example" {
        cluster = resource.nomad_cluster.dev
        ...
      }
    ```
  </Property>
  <Property name="paths" type="[]string" required="true" value="">
    Paths to the Nomad job files to apply to the cluster.
  </Property>

  <Property name="health_check" type="#health_check" required="false" value="">
    Optional health check to perform after the jobs have been applied, this resource
    will not complete until the health checks are passing.
  </Property>
  
  <Property name="wait_until_ready" type="boolean" required="true" value="">
    Determines if the resource waits until all config defined in the paths
    has been accepted and started by the server. If set to false the resource
    returns immediately after submitting the job.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## health_check

A health_check stanza allows the definition of a health check which must 
pass before the resource is marked as successfully created.

```hcl
health_check {
  timeout = "60s"
  pods = [
    "component=server,app=consul", 
    "component=client,app=consul"
  ]
}
```

<Properties>
  <Property name="timeout" type="duration" required="true" value="">
    The maximum duration to wait before marking the health check as failed. 
    Expressed as a Go duration, e.g. `1s` = 1 second, `100ms` = 100 milliseconds.
  </Property>

  <Property name="pods" type="[]string" required="true" value="">
    An array of kubernetes selector syntax. The healthcheck ensures that all
    containers defined by the selector are running before passing the healthcheck.
  </Property>

</Properties>

## Examples

```hcl
resource "k8s_config" "app" {
  cluster = resource.k8s_cluster.k3s

  paths = [
    "./k8s_config/app",
    "./k8s_config/dashboard",
  ]

  wait_until_ready = true
}
```
