## volume

A volume type allows the specification of an attached volume.

<Properties>
  <Property name="source" type="string" required="true" value="">
    The source volume to mount in the container, can be specified as a relative `./` or absolute path `/usr/local/bin`. Relative paths are relative to
the file declaring the container.
  </Property>
  <Property name="destination" type="string" required="true" value="">
    The destination in the container to mount the volume to, must be an absolute path.
  </Property>
  <Property name="type" type="string" required="false" value="bind">
    The type of the mount, can be one of the following values:

    - bind: bind the source path to the destination path in the container
    - volume: source is a Docker volume
    - tmpfs: create a temporary filesystem
  </Property>
  <Property name="bind_propagation" type="string" required="false" value="rprivate">
    Configures bind propagation for Docker volume mounts, only applies to bind mounts, can be one of the following values:

    - shared
    - slave
    - private
    - rslave
    - rprivate

    For more information please see the Docker documentation [https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation)
  </Property>
  <Property name="bind_propagation_non_recursive" type="bool" required="false" value="false">
    We are going to be 100% honest, we have no idea what this option does, but it is a thing so we made it configuable. 
    Would love a PR if you actually know how this is supposed to work.
